	robots to play soccer in unstructured, everyday environments. Unlike
	conventional robot soccer competitions that are usually held on
	purpose-built robot soccer 'fields', in our work we seek to develop
	the capability for robots to demonstrate aspects of soccer-playing
	in more diverse environments, such as schools, hospitals, or shopping
	malls, with static obstacles (furniture) and dynamic natural obstacles
	(people). This problem of 'Soccer Anywhere' presents numerous research
	challenges including: (1) Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
	(SLAM) in dynamic, unstructured environments, (2) software control
	architectures for decentralized, distributed control of mobile agents,
	(3) integration of vision-based object tracking with dynamic control,
	and (4) social interaction with human participants. In addition
	to the intrinsic research merit of these topics, we believe that
	this capability would prove useful for outreach activities, in demonstrating
	robotics technology to primary and secondary school students, to
	motivate them to pursue careers in science and engineering.}

Moreover, there is no adequate conceptual framework within which the various ad hoc search strategies proposed to date can be compared. This paper describes how heuristic information from the problem domain can be incorporated into a formal mathematical theory of graph searching and demonstrates an optimality property of a class of search strategies.},

abstract = {Automatically building maps from sensor data is a necessary and fundamental skill for mobile robots; as a result, considerable research attention has focused on the technical challenges inherent in the mapping problem. While statistical inference techniques have led to computationally efficient mapping algorithms, the next major challenge in robotic mapping is to automate the data collection process. In this paper, we address the problem of how a robot should plan to explore an unknown environment and collect data in order to maximize the accuracy of the resulting map. We formulate exploration as a constrained optimization problem and use reinforcement learning to find trajectories that lead to accurate maps. We demonstrate this process in simulation and show that the learned policy not only results in improved map building, but that the learned policy also transfers successfully to a real robot exploring on MIT campus.},

needs to explore a hypothetical disaster site. The challenge
 faced by the robot-team is to coordinate their actions such that they efficient
ly explore the environment in their search
 for victims.

 A popular paradigm for the exploration problem is based on the notion of fronti
ers: the boundaries of the current map from
 where robots can enter yet unexplored area. Coordinating multiple robots is the
n about intelligently assigning frontiers to
 robots. Typically, the assignment of a particular frontier to a particular robo
t is governed by a cost measure, e.g. the movement
 costs for the robot to reach the frontier. In more recent approaches these cost
s are traded off with the potential gain in
 information if the frontier would be explored by the robot.

 In this paper we will further investigate the effect of balancing movement cost
s with information gains while assigning frontiers
 to robots. In our experiments we will illustrate how various choices for this b
alance can have a significant impact on the
 exploratory behavior exposed by the robot team.

	on the field of mathematical statistics, probabilistic robotics
	endows robots with a new level of robustness in real-world situations.<br
	/> <br /> This book introduces the reader to a wealth of techniques
	and algorithms in the field. All algorithms are based on a single
	overarching mathematical foundation. Each chapter provides example
	implementations in pseudo code, detailed mathematical derivations,
	discussions from a practitioner's perspective, and extensive lists
	of exercises and class projects. The book's Web site, http://www.probabilistic-robotics.org,
	has additional material.<br /> <br /> The book is relevant for anyone
	involved in robotic software development and scientific research.
	It will also be of interest to applied statisticians and engineers
	dealing with real-world sensor data.}},

abstract = {
In this paper, we investigate safe and efficient map-building strategies for a mobile robot with imperfect control and sensing.
In the implementation, a robot equipped with a range sensor builds a polygonal map (layout) of a previously unknown indoor environment.
The robot explores the environment and builds the map concurrently by patching together the local models acquired by the sensor into a global map.
A well-studied and related problem is the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem, where the goal is to integrate the information collected during navigation into the most accurate map possible.
However, SLAM does not address the sensor-placement portion of the map-building task.
That is, given the map built so far, where should the robot go next? This is the main question addressed in this paper.
Concretely, an algorithm is proposed to guide the robot through a series of 'good' positions, where 'good' refers to the expected amount and quality of the information that will be revealed at each new location.
This is similar to the next-best-view (NBV) problem studied in computer vision and graphics.
However, in mobile robotics the problem is complicated by several issues, two of which are particularly crucial.
One is to achieve safe navigation despite an incomplete knowledge of the environment and sensor limitations (e.g., in range and incidence).
The other issue is the need to ensure sufficient overlap between each new local model and the current map, in order to allow registration of successive views under positioning uncertainties inherent to mobile robots.
To address both issues in a coherent framework, in this paper we introduce the concept of a safe region, defined as the largest region that is guaranteed to be free of obstacles given the sensor readings made so far.
The construction of a safe region takes sensor limitations into account. In this paper we also describe an NBV algorithm that uses the safe-region concept to select the next robot position at each step.
The new position is chosen within the safe region in order to maximize the expected gain of information under the constraint that the local model at this new position must have a minimal overlap with the current global map.
In the future, NBV and SLAM algorithms should reinforce each other.
While a SLAM algorithm builds a map by making the best use of the available sensory data, an NBV algorithm, such as that proposed here, guides the navigation of the robot through positions selected to provide the best sensory inputs.
