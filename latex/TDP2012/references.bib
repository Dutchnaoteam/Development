  abstract = {{Probabilistic robotics is a new and growing area in robotics, concerned
	with perception and control in the face of uncertainty. Building
	on the field of mathematical statistics, probabilistic robotics
	endows robots with a new level of robustness in real-world situations.<br
	/> <br /> This book introduces the reader to a wealth of techniques
	and algorithms in the field. All algorithms are based on a single
	overarching mathematical foundation. Each chapter provides example
	implementations in pseudo code, detailed mathematical derivations,
	discussions from a practitioner's perspective, and extensive lists
	of exercises and class projects. The book's Web site, http://www.probabilistic-robotics.org,
	has additional material.<br /> <br /> The book is relevant for anyone
	involved in robotic software development and scientific research.
	It will also be of interest to applied statisticians and engineers
	dealing with real-world sensor data.}},
